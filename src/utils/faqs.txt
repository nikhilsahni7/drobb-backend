FAQs

How does the "Tinder for Clothes" feature work?
Drobb's unique "Tinder for Clothes" feature lets you discover new styles and brands by swiping through a curated feed of clothing items. Swipe left if you're not interested, and swipe right if you like it! The more you swipe, the better Drobb gets at understanding your style preferences.

What kind of brands can I find on Drobb?
Drobb is home to a diverse range of fashion brands, from established names to up-and-coming designers and independent labels. We focus on curating unique and trendy pieces you won't find everywhere, with a special emphasis on supporting emerging talent.

How are my style recommendations personalized?
Our AI-powered recommendation engine learns your style preferences based on your swipes, browsing history, and purchase behavior. The more you use Drobb, the more personalized and accurate your recommendations become.

What is Drobb's return policy?
Drobb is a marketplace platform, so each brand has its own return policy. You can find the specific return policy for each item on the product page. Please check the return policy before making a purchase. Generally, returns are accepted within a specified timeframe, and refunds are processed after the returned item is received and inspected by the seller.

How do I contact customer support?
You can contact our customer support team through the "Help" section in the app. You can also reach us via email at customersupport@drobb.in. We're here to assist you with any questions or issues you may have.
